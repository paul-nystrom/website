The purists would argue about these two terms and get wrapped around the axle. TRF is technically a version of IF. There are no definitive long-term studies that prove which IF or TRF protocol is the "best." Being a purist is not necessary, although calorie restriction and IF are not the same.

We evolved in a world of feast and famine. (Famine is fasting, but not by choice—i.e., starving.) We now live in a world of only feasting, with groceries within blocks, a fridge/freezer in your kitchen, another freezer in the basement, and a beer fridge in the garage. There is no shortage of food in our modern environment, but that does not mean feasting without fasting is normal.

In fact, fasting is perfectly normal.

Babies are born in ketosis.

Newborns on breast milk are in ketosis.

When we're sick, we naturally fast because ketosis has anti-inflammatory effects.

Most major religions talk about fasting.

I think one of the biggest benefits that doesn't get talked about enough is the advantage for shift workers—particularly those on dog watch, when food choices are limited or completely unavailable without pre-packing meals. Just don't eat. Eat before you go to work; eat when you get home. I only work night shifts and never need to eat on shift.

When you're used to it, energy holds steady, and you're free from thinking about food. Life becomes simpler: no worrying about where your next meal will come from, no making terrible choices from the gas station, no stress that you "have" to have food to function.

Critics argue it's restrictive, but what's actually more restrictive? Constantly worrying about your next meal, fluctuating energy levels, and being "hangry"... or just doing life and eating whenever it works out?
