The post below is from The Carnivore RN on X.

The point is that most people don't know what they don't know. We assume the food we eat is not the issue for the symptoms that we assume are a normal part of life or a normal part of aging. Until you cut the offending food out, you don't know for sure.

Maybe food is not the issue for you and you can eat anything and feel healthy and be healthy. But in my experience, that is the exception rather than the rule.

So unless you are in perfect health, i.e. feeling and performing the best you can, chances are good you could feel better and be healthier and you haven't pulled the right food lever yet.

"You don't even know you could be sick until you change your diet. Foods you thought were healthy could actually be causing health issues.

Those oats or legumes high in phytic acid could be blocking absorption of nutrients like iron, calcium, and magnesium.

Those spinach smoothies and soy milk full of oxalates could be contributing to your joint pain and kidney stones.

Those beans and nuts very low in bioavailable protein and fat could be causing deficiencies. That tofu high in estrogenic compounds could be disrupting your hormones.

Those low-fat foods could be contributing to hormonal imbalances and mental health issues.

Those high-sugar foods could be contributing to your cravings and gout.

The high-fiber foods could be causing gut inflammation and damaging the intestinal lining.

The fresh fruit and vegetables high in pesticides could be causing acute issues like headaches, dizziness, digestive problems, and skin issues, and long-term issues like increased risk of cancer.

Changing your diet and eliminating all foods that could cause problems will quickly show you if you have health issues or not."
