Dr. Paul Nystrom, originally from Minnesota, is a seasoned Emergency Medicine physician with a robust background in both EM and EMS. He earned his medical degree from the University of Iowa in 2005 and completed his Emergency Medicine Residency at Hennepin County Medical Center in 2012. Following this, he pursued a 2-year EMS Fellowship, which included police academy training at Hennepin Technical College. Dr. Nystrom also served four years on active duty in the U.S. Navy between medical school and residency training, including a Transitional Internship in Portsmouth, VA, and six months of Dive Medical Officer/Undersea Medical Officer training in Groton, CT, and Panama City, FL. Just prior to his residency, he was stationed in San Diego, CA, with Naval Special Warfare Group ONE.

Currently, Dr. Nystrom works night shifts in the Emergency Department, serves as an EMS medical director, and works part-time as a police officer for a suburban agency, primarily as a medical asset on the SWAT team and also a defensive tactics instructor.

With 20 years as an MD, 13 years experience at a Level 1 trauma center, and 4 years exclusively on night shifts, he has developed a keen interest in wellness for public safety personnel, particularly law enforcement. He understands the demands of shift work and the difficulties of maintaining healthy habits. Having observed that Big Medicine often focuses on downstream consequences and chronic conditions rather than prevention, Dr. Nystrom has dedicated the past 15 years to promoting upstream interventions. He emphasizes Better Nutrition, Prioritizing Sleep, Smarter Exercise, and Being Community, sharing these principles through presentations at local police departments, regional trainings, and statewide conferences, earning recognition across the metro area and outstate Minnesota.

He is available for personal consultations, department training, and larger speaking engagements.
