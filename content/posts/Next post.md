I took care of a woman with upper back pain after a fall. The patient had recently been diagnosed with metastatic cancer; I don’t recall the specific type of cancer, but she had known metastatic disease in her bones. She also had underlying issues with unsteadiness and balance.

In the ER, she was found to have a fracture in her upper thoracic spine. There are many types of spinal fractures, but this one caused pain without significant structural problems. It did not require surgery or a brace; however, it was quite painful for her.

When discussing these results with the patient, she had two or three very supportive friends with her. Because of her balance issues, now complicated by a fall, her friends were discussing 24/7 care for her. They asked me if someone needed to stay with her from now on.

My answer was an emphatic no, absolutely not. 

This patient was not at the stage of end-stage cancer. While her cancer was metastatic, she was still relatively functional. She was not bed-bound and lived independently at home despite her balance issues. I explained that starting 24/7 care at this point would effectively end her independence. I did not believe it was in her best interest to lose that solely because of this decrease in functioning. In the future, she might need more care, but we had not reached that point yet.

Her friends also did not fully appreciate the logistical challenges that would follow. Arranging 24/7 care is no small matter. The friends were clearly supportive and well-meaning, and I got the sense they had the resources to help her. However, they had not considered that 24/7 care is a marathon, not a sprint. They could likely afford to take a day or two away from their lives, jobs, and other responsibilities to stay with her, but they did not seem to grasp what 24/7 care entails, especially when committing to it for weeks, months, or, in this case, potentially years.

The discussion with everyone in the room seemed very positive. They appeared to appreciate my insight.

Another risk is the development of learned helplessness. The less someone does for themselves, the less they tend to do. Once an elderly person becomes frailer, they should certainly be cautious about using stairs, avoiding trip hazards in the home, and navigating uneven sidewalks or icy surfaces. However, the downside is that they may stop doing anything altogether. They might avoid all risks, becoming completely sedentary and dependent on others.

This is not good for their physical health. Sedentary behavior has its own complications, including loss of mobility and increased weakness. Losing independence is also mentally challenging as you age, as it is difficult to lose the ability to do things you’ve always done. I have seen this happen with other elderly patients and, in the worst cases, with relatively young patients—perhaps in their 40s or 50s—who, because of a chronic illness, become almost entirely dependent on their spouse or significant other.

I observed these dynamics in the ER during my evaluation. For example, I’ve seen patients who are unable to sit up when asked or get out of bed, and their immediate reaction is to turn to their significant other for help, even when there is no functional reason they cannot move themselves. Too often, the significant other contributes to this dysfunction by immediately offering to assist. It’s awkward to watch, and it feels uncomfortable when a patient asks me for help with something they are perfectly capable of doing. As part of my assessment and physical exam, I don’t immediately offer assistance. The patient may then turn to their significant other, who sometimes jumps out of their chair to help.

Needless to say, this dynamic is dysfunctional and, most importantly, not good for the patient.
